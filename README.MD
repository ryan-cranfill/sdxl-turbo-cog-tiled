# Running Locally
First, download the pre-trained weights:

    cog run script/download-weights

If you get an error, you may need to `chmod 777 script/download-weights`

Build the docker image:

    cog build -t sdxl-turbo-cog

Run the docker image:

    docker-compose up

# stabilityai/sdxl-turbo

This is an implementation of the [stabilityai/sdxl-turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo) as a Cog model. [Cog packages machine learning models as standard containers.](https://github.com/replicate/cog)

First, download the pre-trained weights:

    cog run script/download-weights

Then, you can run predictions:

    cog predict -i prompt="21 years old girl,short cut,beauty,dusk,Ghibli style illustration"

## Example:

"21 years old girl,short cut,beauty,dusk,Ghibli style illustration"
